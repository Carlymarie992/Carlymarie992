# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlymarie992

## Paralegal | Student Ambassador | Legal Tech Innovator

### ⚡ About Me

I'm a paralegal and student ambassador passionate about harnessing **AI and legal technology** to drive real change. My journey blends my experience in law with my love for **Python** and coding, where I'm spearheading projects that tackle some of the most pressing problems in justice and protection.

---

### 🚀 What I'm Building

**Major Project:**  
I'm developing advanced tools to **parse, transcribe, timestamp, and analyze massive volumes of communication data**. My goal? To **identify patterns of systemic abuse, legal abuse, and coercive control**—making it faster and less stressful to obtain justice and protection, especially for those targeted by manipulative tactics like DARVO.

- **Automated sender and message identification**
- **Pattern recognition in documented communication**
- **Empowering people to protect their reputation and credibility**

Imagine taking **hours, years, and priceless stress** out of fighting for justice—so you can live your life, not just fight your case.
