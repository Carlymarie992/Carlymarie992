## Carly Marie Cheney

**UX Engineer | AI Product Strategist | Python Developer**

I am a self-directed developer and researcher focused on **Information Architecture** and **Human-Centered AI**. I specialize in building tools that translate high-stakes, unstructured data into clear, objective narratives.

### 👤 About Me: The Self-Directed Edge

My background is built on a foundation of independent, rigorous study. Without a traditional classroom, I have cultivated a disciplined approach to project management and technical mastery:

* **Rapid Upskilling:** Independently mastered a production-grade Python stack, moving from basic scripts to complex NLP and forensic data pipelines.
* **Meticulous Documentation:** I treat my READMEs and code comments as a user interface—ensuring my logic is transparent and my environments are 100% reproducible.
* **Domain Expertise:** I don't just write code; I research the "why." My work is deeply grounded in legal research (North Dakota jurisdiction) and behavioral ethics.

### 🛡️ Featured Project: Coercive Control Analyzer

**UX Challenge:** How do you help a user identify subtle, dangerous patterns in 1,000+ pages of communication logs without causing "analysis paralysis"?

* **The Solution:** A Python-based diagnostic tool that uses `NLTK` and `scikit-learn` to map behavioral cycles.
* **The Interface:** I use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create data visualizations that act as a "cognitive shortcut," allowing users to see frequency and intensity at a glance.
* **Technical Rigor:** Built with a strict dependency manifest (`pdfForensic`, `pandas>=2.0.0`) to ensure reliability in legal contexts.

### 📫 Let's Connect

I value professional, neutral, and high-signal communication. I am looking for a team that values a developer who can think like a user and execute like a scientist.
